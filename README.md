# Mini Mill V1

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xSJMjRZ/MILLv2.png" alt="MILLv2" border="0">

Based on an OpenBuilds Mini Mill, powered by an RPi4 with three axis and remote jog controller. Designed and built to facilitate aluminum fabrication of 7-axis robotic arm. Flood and lubrication system not yet designed. Enclosure last. To be updated regularly. This repository is meant to contain all research, design ethos, practical guides, tutorials, and step-by-step build log which I failed to find anywhere in forums and in distributor documentation. All builds are unique, but a comprehnsive, cohesive, and collated build log and database was unavailable when I began this project in Aug. 2020. 

This is also a first-attempt and meant to be a point of learning and failure ahead of a larger build. 

_Latest Progress: 
11/28/2020 -- Finalizing CAD model and BOM._
