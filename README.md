# Mini Mill V1

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/31wSWwb/MILLV3.png" alt="MILLV3" ALIGN="right"/>

Based on an OpenBuilds Mini Mill, powered by an RPi4 with three axis and remote GRBL jog controller. 

The mill was designed and built with four goals in mind:

* Compact yet powerful, with a minimal electronic and mechanical footprint and room for drain basket and sprayer systems
*	Aesthetically pleasing, an art piece for my work shed
*	Capable of machining all parts necessary to build a 7-axis Aluminum robotic arm (see: <a href="https://github.com/kennethrrosen/AR4Mega_theAR2remix/">ARM repository</a>)
*	Practice build for bigger mill in shed or in Massachusetts
 
A flood and lubrication system will be designed later, once the enclosure is finished. I will regularly update this page, as this repository is meant to contain all research, design ethos, practical guides, tutorials, and step-by-step build log which I failed to find anywhere in forums and in distributor documentation. 

All builds are unique, but a comprehnsive, cohesive, and collated build log and database was unavailable when I began this project in Aug. 2020. </a>

This is also a first-attempt and meant to be a point of learning and failure ahead of large, similar projects. 

_Latest Progress: 
11/28/2020 -- Finalizing CAD model and BOM._
